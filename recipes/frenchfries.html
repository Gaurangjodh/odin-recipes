    <h3>Crispy and seasoned fried potato strips</h3>
    <p>The extra step of battering the fries adds so much flavor, this is a whole different French fry experience</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Â½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>oil</li>
        <li>flour</li>
        <li>spices</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning brown.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon.</li>
        <li>Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time.</li>
        <li>Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
